This project aims to recreate the results produced by two papers:
1. Coronary Artery Centerline Extraction in Cardiac CT Angiography Using a CNN-Based Orientation Classifier
2. Discriminative Coronary Artery Tracking via 3D CNN in Cardiac CT Angiography

In short, this project implements a  discriminative coronary artery tracking method (DCAT) that utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a tracking algorithm to automatically extract the coronary artery centerlines in a cardiac CT angiography (CCTA)
